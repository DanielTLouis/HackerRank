"""
Quibd√≥ in Colombia is one among the cities that receive maximum rainfall in the world.
All year round, the city is covered in clouds. The city has many towns, located on a
one-dimensional line. The positions and populations of each town on the number line are known
to you. Every cloud covers all towns located at a certain distance from it. A town is said to
be in darkness if there exists at least one cloud such that the town is within the cloud's
range. Otherwise, it is said to be sunny.
image
The city council has determined that they have enough money to remove exactly one cloud using
their latest technology. Thus they want to remove the cloud such that the fewest number of
people are left in darkness after the cloud is removed. What is the maximum number of people
that will be in a sunny town after removing exactly one cloud?
Note: If a town is not covered by any clouds, then it is already considered to be sunny, and
the population of this town must also be included in the final answer.
Complete the function maximumPeople which takes four arrays representing the populations of
each town, locations of the towns, locations of the clouds, and the extents of coverage of the
clouds respectively, and returns the maximum number of people that will be in a sunny town
after removing exactly one cloud.
Input Format
    The first line of input contains a single integer n, the number of towns.
    The next line contains n space-separated integers pi. The ith integer in this line denotes
    the population of the ith town.
    The next line contains n space-separated integers xi denoting the location of the ith town
    on the one-dimensional line.
    The next line consists of a single integer m denoting the number of clouds covering the
    city.
    The next line contains m space-separated integers yi the ith of which denotes the location
    of the ith cloud on the coordinate axis.
    The next line consists of m space-separated integers ri denoting the range of the ith cloud.
    Note: The range of each cloud is computed according to its location, i.e., the ith cloud is
    located at position yi and it covers every town within a distance of ri from it. In other
    words, the ith cloud covers every town with location in the range [yi-ri, yi+ri].
Constraints
    1<=n<=2X10^5
    1<=m<=!0^5
    1<=xi,yi,ri,pi<=10^9
Output Format
    Print a single integer denoting the maximum number of people that will be in a sunny town
    by removing exactly one cloud.
Sample Input 0
    2
    10 100
    5 100
    1
    4
    1
Sample Output 0
    110
Explanation 0
    In the sample case, there is only one cloud which covers the first town. Our only choice is
    to remove this sole cloud which will make all towns sunny, and thus, all 110 people will
    live in a sunny town.
        image
    As you can see, the only cloud present, is at location 4 on the number line and has a range
    1, so it covers towns located at 3, 4 and 5 on the number line. Hence, the first town is
    covered by this cloud and removing this cloud makes all towns sunny.
