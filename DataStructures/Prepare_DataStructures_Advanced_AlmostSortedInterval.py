"""
Shik loves sorted intervals. But currently he does not have enough time to sort all the
numbers. So he decided to use Almost sorted intervals. An Almost sorted interval is a
consecutive subsequence in a sequence which satisfies the following property:
    1. The first number is the smallest.
    2. The last number is the largest.
Please help him count the number of almost sorted intervals in this permutation.
Note: Two intervals are different if at least one of the starting or ending indices are
different.
Input Format
    The first line contains an integer N.
    The second line contains a permutation from 1 to N.
Output Format
    Output the number of almost sorted intervals.
Constraints
    1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 10^6
Sample Input
    5
    3 1 2 5 4
Sample Output
    8
Explanation
    The subsequences [3], [1], [1 2], [1 2 5], [2], [2 5], [5], [4] are almost sorted
    intervals.
